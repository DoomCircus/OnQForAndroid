OnQ Android app

Note about OnQ source code:
======================================================================================================================
My apologies, but code commenting is currently minimal due to the time crunch for getting this app finished (planned
completion date is approximately the end of March) and there is still more functionality that is missing other than
the incomplete methods in DeckManager.java

About OnQ for Android:

OnQ is a mobile app being developed on the Android platform that will allow users who are subscribed to the OnQ
